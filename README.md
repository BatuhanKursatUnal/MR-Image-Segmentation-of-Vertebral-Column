This is an image segmentation project that runs on Python and includes two main parts: preprocessing of the data and the UNet model and implementation.

# Data

The dataset used for this study contains multi-center lumbar spine MR images collected from patients with lower back pain with the aim of segmenting spinal canal, vertebrae, and intervertebral discs. Data collected from 257 patients contained at most 3 MRI series. Out of these 257, 218 studies including 447 MRI series are made publicly available. 447 T1 and T2-weighted MR images are collected from the 218 patients with pain in their lower back, of which 63% were female.  After the necessary data preparation and cleaning, 358 of these images were found appropriate to use in this project.
